      <p>1..... Those who are too opinionated will be left in solitude.
 ....Animals have the same rights as humans <br>

 ....Negative thoughts will <br>
 result in a week in solitude It is tradition to eat <br>
  family members who have reached 100 to gain good
  fortune Never pass a snake without bowing as a way
  of showing respect it is bad luck to eat with you <br>

  toes saying "no" is a taboo eating meat from any <br>
  species other than your own taboo
