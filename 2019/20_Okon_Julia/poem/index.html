    <br> 2. There is a holiday in which you become best friends with your enemy
    <br> 3. If you ever find yourself on top of a building or cliff you must jump off
    <br> 4. There are gangs of animals that walk around and beat people up sometimes
    <br> 5. When you become overwhelmed with a negative emotion you turn into a creature that embodies that feeling for the time being
    <br> 6. You can never walk anywhere only walk
    <br> 7. People carry around sticks with them and use them as weapons
    <br> 8. Everyone lives in caves
    <br> 9. The earth is flat
    <br> 10. The earth is round"</h2>
