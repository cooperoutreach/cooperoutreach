Nothing we learn in life is useless. However, we probably won't find a use for it anytime soon.

The only race I ever won was the sperm race, and even then I sometimes wish I'd lost.

The shit hit the fan a while ago, and now we're left to deal with the mess.

Just as showers are just domesticated waterfalls, ashes are just domesticated memories.

Everyone goes t school, but I'm the only one really present, and sometimes not even then.

The human condition is terminal.
