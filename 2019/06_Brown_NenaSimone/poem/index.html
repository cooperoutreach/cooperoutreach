      style="font-size:50px;color:lightblue;">Masking to be our friend
      <br>Despite its actions to be the enemy
  <br>Leading people to their end
  <br>And addictive as ecstasy
  <br>Used as a way to spy
  <br>Used as a distraction
  <br>Its deceiving to the eye
  <br>As the easiest way of interaction
  <br>Yes it has its pros
  <br>It helps us everyday
  <br>And keeps things from moving slow
  <br>But it destroys in a way
  <br>Open up. Stop being blind
  <br>In your hand isn't perfection
  <br>C'mon lets take back mankind
  <br>Realize <a class="technology" href="1technology.html">technology</a> is an infection

      </h3>
