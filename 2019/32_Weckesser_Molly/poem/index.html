      <p><i>There are 500 people in my town. If someone dies, someone else must be born.
        <br>Everyone in my town is trained to be an astrophysicist.
        <br>The oldest man in the town <a href="tomato1.html">grows tomatoes in his backyard.</a>
        <br>Children go to school 4 days a week.
        <br>The poorest woman in the town is 77 years old.
        <br>The only thing to do for fun is to go bowling.
        <br>Every month an airplane flies over the entire town, no one knows why.
        <br><a href="bees.html">You would be able to see the big dipper</a>, but the view is obstructed by a volcano.
        <br>The only crime that ever happened in my town was 50 years ago.
        <br>Every 4th of July, <a href="elephant.html">my town sets off fireworks</a>.
