<h3>The children are taught to hold their breath and be quiet.
<br></br>
There are no automobiles in the village anymore.
<br></br>
The floodgate never stops creaking.
<br></br>
When January comes, you may leave the village without fear.

        and   <br></br>
          <br></br>stand   <br></br>
