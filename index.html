    <h1>The Winter Outreach Program Collage Explorations | Basic HTML With Guest Partner<em> Ava’s Smile</em></h1>

      The Outreach Program provides free studio arts education in the Fall, Winter, and Spring seasons for New York City area high school students, grades 10-12. Classes include drawing, photography, two and three-dimensional design, and coding, with seminars in creative writing and contemporary art issues. High school students enrolled in either a public or private school are eligible to apply to the Program through a portfolio review held three times throughout the year. Each seasonal program is designed to meet the specific needs of the sophomore, junior or senior interested in building a portfolio. The program also includes college counseling and college essay writing workshops. Each season concludes with a student exhibition and poetry readings are held in the spring and fall. All Outreach classes are taught by college level instructors and Cooper Union undergraduate teaching assistants, and are held on Cooper Union’s campus.
    </p>

      Our partner, <em>Ava’s Smile</em>, contributes each year toward a special project in memory of Outreach Alumna, Ava Hecht. Ava was a vivacious and multi-talented student of Stuyvesant High School and attended Outreach in the summer and fall of 2008. We celebrate Ava’s achievements and artistic spirit with a guest artist and an innovative project in new media each winter. Ava lives on in the multitude of art works she inspires.
